# Includes
Chip specific files go here to be included in the compilation process.
Currently, only the STM32F446XX series is supported. These files are vended into
the repository from the manufacturer's published libraries. Each MCU will have
its own folder containing the assembly code to configure the stack and heap as
well as system header files.
